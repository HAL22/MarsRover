--Instruction--

Java version 12  was used. It is better to use  Intellij IDE as a setup the environment. You can find a free version of Intellij or a trail version.

Commands are inputted via a text file( the folder that has the commands is testfile). To use a textfile, you have to give the file path to the driver class as a program argument( i.e args).

--Design decision--

I envisioned the rover  navigation system as an object that routinely received commands. That's why I wanted to use an OOP language. 

--Testing--  

To ensure code correction I perform Junit testing. The Junit testing can be found in the Tests folder. Junit 4 was used.
